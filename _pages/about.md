I'm a a first-year PhD student from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/) and [Shanghai Innovation Institute](https://www.sii.edu.cn). My research interest focus on Large Language Models(LLM), including pretraining, post-training and embodied intellegence. 

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xipeng Qiu](https://xpqiu.github.io) from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/).
